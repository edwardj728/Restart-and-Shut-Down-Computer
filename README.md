# Restart-and-Shut-Down-Computer
This script allows you to restart, and then shut down your computer without doing anything. Just run the script and confirm.

What will this do exactly?

1. Open/run the script/program.
2. The program will reboot or restart your computer.
3. Once your computer is back on the desktop from the reboot, the program will shutdown your computer.
4. Turn your computer on and enjoy it.

What is this used for?

This is useful because sometimes restarting your computer doesn't fix the issue you may be having with your computer, such as lag or flickering. By restarting it and then shutting it down, it seems to fix a lot of those issues.
